# RaptureTutorials

RaptureTutorials is a set of Tutorials designed to demonstrate Incapture's Rapture platform.

Each tutorial:
- Is designed to be used in conjuction with an Incapture developer portal account and environment
- Uses a free hosted trial instance for each new demo environment
- Comes in three language flavors: Java, Python and Reflex

It is recommended to start with Intro01 tutorial. This is an introductory guide to basic API usage including login and data related actions with a Rapture instance.

# Rapture Design Objectives

- Access data through an abstracted, consistent API; enable developers to realize the functional benefits of new data storage approaches without having to rewrite applications
- Native support for document, blob, series data types
- Automated versioning and metadata tagging that delivers operational intelligence
- APIs support numerous development languages and frameworks
- Robust entitlements mechanisms to support role based access to data and services
- Includes Reflex, a powerful, extensible scripting language that enables efficient data manipulation
- <should we add more aspirational aspects of Rapture e.g. catalog Index and searching)?>
